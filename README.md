Polymer Chemistry
============
If by any chance you are Dr. Micheli and you came across my new GitHub repository while googling my friend's source codes, then you know who I am. I offered my help teaching them Python for their final project. I also partook in making the final project as a fun side-activity. I gave them my source code before I had this repository. However, I explicitly told them to not just copy and paste it, but to attempt to understand it. I gave it to them as a guide from which they could draw inspiration and knowledge. As far as I know, some of them translated it to other languages. I also gave them a whole host of resources that I had made/found and even directly taught many of them.

These are written in Python 3 because don't need the more obscure python 2.7 functionality.

These are two final projects from the undergrad polymer chemistry course at my school. I only had to make the copolymerisation program. But I found the 3D polymer project to be very intriguing.

The copolymerisation program will be uploaded at a later, undetermined date, because it was my first time and I ended up with a 1.8k line behemoth. It could have all been reduced through the use of functions. Alas, I was not aware of the need to declare variables as global inside them. It made debugging a bitch.
