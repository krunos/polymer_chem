Polymer Chemistry
============
These are written in Python 3 because don't need the more obscure python 2.7 functionality.

These are two final projects from the undergrad polymer chemistry course at my school. I only had to make the copolymerisation program. But I found the 3D polymer project to be very intriguing.

The copolymerisation program will be uploaded at a later, undisclosed date, because it was my first time and I ended up with a 1.8k line behemoth. It could have all been reduced through the use of functions. Alas, I was not aware of the need to declare variables as global inside them. It made debugging a bitch.
