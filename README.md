Polymer Chemistry
============
If by any chance you are Dr. Micheli and you came across my new GitHub repository while googling my friend's source codes, then you know who I am. I offered my help by teaching them Python for their final project. I also partook in making the final project as a fun side-activity. I also gave them my source code before I had this repository, I know Julio translated it to English--that was before I did.

I explicitly told everyone to not just copy and paste my code, but to attempt to understand it. I gave it to them as a guide from which they could draw inspiration and knowledge. As far as I know, some of them translated it to other languages and I think that's fine. I also gave them a whole host of resources that I had made or found and even directly taught many of them. I offered many chances for them to learn, even when I was busy with my own shit. So if any do end up giving you my source code, then I cannot defend their actions. There are a few who were always asking for help and guidance, so if you have any doubts as to the legitimacy of any of their work, don't hesitate to ask for my appraisal.

These are written in Python 3 because I don't need the more obscure python 2.7 functionality.

These are two final projects from the undergrad polymer chemistry course at my school. I only had to make the copolymerisation program. But I found the 3D polymer project to be very intriguing.

The copolymerisation program will be uploaded at a later, undetermined date, because it was my first time and I ended up with a 1.8k line behemoth. It could have all been reduced through the use of functions. Alas, I was not aware of the need to declare variables as global inside them. It made debugging a bitch.
