I'm not responsible for computers crapping on the end-user up as a result of my code.

The code is provided as is, and there is no guarantee that I will fix bugs.

Suggestions on improving my code are always welcome.

You may use, distribute and pass my code along to whomever you please. You don't even have to give me credit, but it's always nice.

The only thing truly I ask of you is the following:

If you found my code in any way, shape or form helpful; then pay it forward. When someone else needs your help, offer it. This is my philosophy and it's the only thing I demand of whoever receives my help directly or indirectly. Lets make the world a better place one helping hand at a time.
